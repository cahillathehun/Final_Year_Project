> Ensure that the Supervisor formally agrees to supervise your project; this is only recognised once the
> Supervisor assigns herself/himself via the project Dashboard.
>
> Project proposals without an assigned
> Supervisor will not be accepted for presentation to the Approval Panel.

## SECTION B

> Guidance: This document is expected to be approximately 3 pages in length, but it can exceed this page limit.
> It is also permissible to carry forward content from this proposal to your later documents (e.g. functional
> specification) as appropriate.
>
> Your proposal must include *at least* the following sections.


### Introduction

> Describe the general area covered by the project.

### Outline

> Outline the proposed project.

### Background

> Where did the ideas come from?
The fact that we had completed an "Ant colony simulation" had inspired us to steer away from simple food/enemy based pathfinding to BOIDS. 
The learning that had resulted directly from working on the Ant Colony intruiged and highly interested both of us. 
The pathfinding in the ant colony simulation was very basic and each ant only "thought" about it's own best interests, with BOIDS the emphasis is on large flocking behaviours.

### Achievements

> What functions will the project provide? Who will the users be?
The program will be a simulation using BOIDS to simulate flocking behaviours, demonstrating a form of swarm intelligence. 

### Justification

> Why/when/where/how will it be useful?

### Programming language(s)

> List the proposed language(s) to be used.

### Programming tools / Tech stack

> Describe the compiler, database, web server, etc., and any other software tools you plan to use.

### Hardware

> Describe any non-standard hardware components which will be required.

### Learning Challenges

> List the main new things (technologies, languages, tools, etc) that you will have to learn.

### Breakdown of work

> Clearly identify who will undertake which parts of the project.
>
> It must be clear from the explanation of this breakdown of work both that each student is responsible for
> separate, clearly-defined tasks, and that those responsibilities substantially cover all of the work required
> for the project.
