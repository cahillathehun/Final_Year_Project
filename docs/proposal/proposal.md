### Introduction

> Describe the general area covered by the project.

This will be a JavaScript project using Websockets and WebGL graphics to create a game with the aim of flocking objects away from your world and into another players.
The aim of this project is to create a real time multi-user environment as well as to implement a Boids algorithm.

    


### Outline

> Outline the proposed project.

Our proposed project is to make a multiplayer game where players have to chase flocks of animals from their screen to their opponent's screen using their cursor, or their finger in the case of touch screen phones/tablets.

The flock behaviour will be similar to Boids in how they flock together and avoid obstacles (the cursor).

### Background

> Where did the ideas come from?

The fact that we had completed an "Ant colony simulation" had inspired us to steer away from simple food/enemy based pathfinding to BOIDS. 
The learning that had resulted directly from working on the Ant Colony intruiged and highly interested both of us. 
The pathfinding in the ant colony simulation was very basic and each ant only "thought" about it's own best interests, with BOIDS the emphasis is on large flocking behaviours.

### Achievements

> What functions will the project provide? Who will the users be?

The program will be a simulation using BOIDS to simulate flocking behaviours, demonstrating a form of swarm intelligence.

This program will also be demonstrating multiple users being hosted on a single instance.

### Justification

> Why/when/where/how will it be useful?

### Programming language(s)

> List the proposed language(s) to be used.

The primary language we intend to use is Javascript. We will also be making use of external graphical libraries gotten from Three.js, an open source JavaScript library that uses WebGL.



### Programming tools / Tech stack

> Describe the compiler, database, web server, etc., and any other software tools you plan to use.

Java Socket/ServerSocket/Websockets will be used for connectivity and hosting.

Node.js

IntelliJ IDE.

### Hardware

> Describe any non-standard hardware components which will be required.

We will be using our own machines for hosting and development, and also the lab machines in DCU for development.

There are hardware requirements beyond these and no non-standard hardware requirements.


### Learning Challenges

> List the main new things (technologies, languages, tools, etc) that you will have to learn.

The main new challenge facing us is the networking aspect of the project. We have only encountered a limited amount of this before so most of what we will be undertaking in this area will be new to us.




### Breakdown of work

> Clearly identify who will undertake which parts of the project.
>
> It must be clear from the explanation of this breakdown of work both that each student is responsible for
> separate, clearly-defined tasks, and that those responsibilities substantially cover all of the work required
> for the project.
