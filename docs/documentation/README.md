Place your user manual and technical documentation in this directory.

PDF is the preferred format.

The first page of each document should contain at least:

- your names,
- your project title,
- the type of document (e.g. *Technical Manual*)
- your student IDs, and
- the date you finished working on the document.

In addition, the file names you choose to use should make clear what the document content is.

**The final version of your documents should be converted to PDF and stored in this same directory**

*Do not place any other files in this directory.*

This is a project unertaken by lexander Cahll and Liam O Cearbhaill.
The aim of this project is to implement a boids algorithm and achieving multiple
users within a single instance with the use of websockets.
# ==============================
It is worth noting here that due to the lack of documentation with regards to socekt.io
multiple errors have been encountered which were found to be unavoidable.
Some errors thrown are known issues with socket.io however they have never been
addressed. What this means is that certain functions could not be imported for
unit testing. As such, functions have been recreated to allow for such testing,
however this means that test driven development was never on the cards for this
project. We both wish that socket.io would have more comprehensive documentation
as on paper it looks useful and easy to use while in reality it turns out to be
a headache.
We found StackOverflow to contain more useful information than socket.io's own
official documentation.
