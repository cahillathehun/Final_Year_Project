# From a user perspective:

User eners MUBS via browser.

User has the option to enter a game room.

Matchmaking will pair two users together at a time

Users then can use touch or mouse cursor to repulse the birds from their own
screen and watch as they flock to their opponents screen. Notice how the birds
do not clash with each other and move smoothly similarily to real birds' flocking
behaviours.
